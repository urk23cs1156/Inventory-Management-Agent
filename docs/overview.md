# Project Overview

The Inventory Management System with Intelligent Agent is a web-based application designed to assist businesses in managing inventory efficiently and intelligently.

Traditional inventory systems mainly focus on storing and displaying data. This project goes a step further by integrating an intelligent agent that actively analyzes inventory levels and assists in restocking decisions.

The system continuously monitors the current stock quantity of each item and compares it with a predefined minimum threshold. When stock levels fall below the threshold, the intelligent agent automatically recommends an optimal restocking quantity.

The application is lightweight, easy to deploy, and suitable for educational purposes as well as small-scale real-world inventory management use cases.
